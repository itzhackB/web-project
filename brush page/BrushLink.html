    <p id=p_1>As you should know, brushing is the key component to getting the best waves.
        The more you brush the faster your waves will come in.
        There are many different wave brushes available today and this page
        will help teach you about a select few</p>
    <hr>

    <p>
    <ul id=list>
        <li><b>Hard-bristle wave brushes</b> feature hard natural bristles (which are still softer than a regular hair
            brush) that
            can get through thicker or coarser hair. Hard bristles will bring your wave out quicker than softer bristles
            but
            can be too harsh on the scalp if you’ve got short or thin hair. This type is also effective at removing
            tangles
            and can be used in the shower to help your waves lay down.</li>

        <li><b>Soft-bristle wave brushes</b> have softer, more flexible natural bristles and are gentler on the scalp.
            This type is
            more appropriate for fine or short hair and will help keep your waves sleek and flat. These also can be used
            on
            straight hair.</li>

        <li><b>Shape</b>: Round brushes are ideal for long hair and also boost volume. Paddle brushes have large,
            rectangular heads
            that cover and define wider sections of hair more quickly and are ideal for coarse or thick hair types.</li>

        <h2>Wave brush features</h2>

        Double-sided brushes feature hard bristles on one side and soft bristles on the other for ultimate versatility
        for different effects.

        Vented brushes allow air to pass through, which is desirable if you’re using a hair dryer with your brush. This
        feature is also great for shorter hair, especially to create more dramatic, concentrated waves.

        Handle: Some wave brushes have handles and others do not. Brushes that are contoured to fit into the palm of
        your hand may offer more control, especially for beginners. They are also more compact for travel. If you have
        arthritis or other hand pain, a brush with a handle may be easier to use.

        Material: Most quality wave brushes have natural bristles of boar, goat, or horse hair that are widely spaced to
        avoid snagging or frizzing hair. We do not recommend wave brushes with frizz-causing nylon bristles. Most wave
        brushes have a body and handle constructed of wood, which is more durable than plastic.

            <b>
                <li>Tips</li>

                Use your wave brush over each section of your hair for two minutes, going over the same area 15 to 20
                times. Do
                this daily to achieve a defined wave pattern. Always brush in the direction your wave naturally falls.
                To clean
                your wave brush, first remove any hairs stuck in the bristles. Next, clean the bristles with good
                shampoo and
                warm water. Rinse thoroughly, then air dry your brush. Use a wave brush when your hair is still wet and
                conditioned from the shower to help lay your hair down.
